Solutions Engineer with 20+ years of experience in software development, cloud
infrastructure, and systems engineering. Led architectural projects, scalable
cloud solutions, and mentored teams. Expertise spans from web to distributed
systems, passionate about building scalable and maintainable software.

## Uses

My regular tools change as I try new technologies, but I often find myself
returning to my original choices.

## IDE

I was a long time VS Code user but recently switched to [Zed](https://zed.dev).
The auto-language detections are excellent—especially with PHP projects. The
missing Git GUI feature is coming soon. The performance on MacBook Pro displays
is exceptional.

## Terminal

I moved from the default macOS ZSH back to oh my zsh due to missing features.
Currently using [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org), which is exceptionally
responsive, particularly on newer MacBook Pro displays.

## Hardware

My primary machine is a MacBook Pro M4 Pro with 48GB RAM running macOS. I also
maintain a custom desktop running Pop_OS! for Linux work.
